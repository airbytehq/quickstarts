# Stock Data Analytics with Airbyte, Polygon Stock API, and MongoDB

Welcome to the Quickstart guide for "Stock Data Analytics." ðŸŒŸ This guide is your gateway to effortlessly establishing a data stack that combines the power of Airbyte, the Polygon Stock API, and MongoDB. With this streamlined setup, you can seamlessly retrieve stock data from the Polygon Stock API, store it in MongoDB, create aggregations, set up pipelines, and perform in-depth trend analysis.

Our goal is to simplify the process, help you get started promptly, and demonstrate the harmonious collaboration of these tools.

Here is a visual representation of how data flows through our integrated tools in this Quickstart.

Certainly, here are populated prerequisites for your Quickstart guide:

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on this integration, ensure you have the following set up and ready:


## 1. Getting Started with AirByte UI

To get started, make sure you have successfully installed and configured Airbyte's user interface (UI) on your system. You can follow the installation instructions provided in the [Airbyte Documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/).

You can alternatively create a cloud account. In this quickstart, we shall primarily use the cloud  since we have the source and destination up on the interfaces.

## 2. Getting Polygon Stock API

You'll need access to the Polygon Stock API to retrieve real-time or historical stock data. Obtain API keys or necessary credentials from Polygon by signing up on their platform or following their API access instructions.

### Step 1: 
Visit the Polygon website and sign up for an account if you haven't already.

### Step 2: 
Log in to your Polygon account and navigate to the API section.

### Step 3:
Obtain your Polygon Stock API keys or credentials.

## 3. Establish the Source

Set up your data source in Airbyte to connect to the Polygon Stock API. This involves creating a connection to Polygon and configuring it to access the stock data you require. Refer to the [Airbyte Documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/) for guidance on establishing this source.

### Step 1: 
In the Airbyte UI, navigate to the "Sources" section.

### Step 2: 
Click on "Create New Source" and select "Polygon Stock API" as the source type.

### Step 3: 
Configure the source by providing your Polygon Stock API credentials, specifying the data you want to retrieve (e.g., real-time or historical stock data), and setting any additional parameters. Get help [here](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/docs/integrations/sources/polygon-stock-api.md) or watch video at the end.

### Step 4: 
Test the source connection to ensure it's working correctly.


## 4. Setting Up MongoDB Connector

Ensure you have MongoDB installed and set up. You should have MongoDB ready to receive the stock data from Airbyte. If you haven't installed MongoDB yet, follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system on the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

### Step 1: 
If you don't have a MongoDB Atlas account, sign up for one on the MongoDB Atlas website.

### Step 2: 
Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster in your Atlas account. You can follow the cluster creation instructions provided by MongoDB Atlas. Ensure to create a user and allow all IPs (0.0.0.0/0) for database access and rights.

### Step 3: 
Obtain the connection details for your MongoDB Atlas cluster, including the connection string.

### Step 4: 
In the Airbyte UI, navigate to the "Destinations" section.

### Step 5: 
Click on "Create New Destination" and select "MongoDB Atlas" as the destination type.

### Step 6: 
Configure the MongoDB Atlas connector settings by providing the connection string, database credentials, and specifying the database and collection where you want to store the stock data.

Step 7: Test the connector settings to ensure the connection to MongoDB Atlas is successful.


## 5. Configuring AirByte Connector Settings

In Airbyte, configure the connector settings for MongoDB to define where and how the data will be stored. Make sure you have the necessary credentials and connection details ready to complete this step. Refer to the [Airbyte Documentation](https://docs.airbyte.io/) for guidance on configuring connectors.

### Step 1: 
In the Airbyte UI, navigate to the "Destinations" section.

### Step 2: 
Click on "Create New Destination" and select "MongoDB" as the destination type.

### Step 3: 
Configure the MongoDB connector settings by providing the connection details (e.g., host, port), database credentials, and the database and collection names you created in Step 4.

### Step 4: 
Test the connector settings to ensure the connection to MongoDB is successful.

## 6. MongoDB Data Analysis

After successfully setting up the data pipeline, you can start analyzing the data stored in MongoDB. Utilize tools or libraries of your choice, such as Python, MongoDB's native query language, or MongoDB-compatible data analysis tools, to perform stock data analysis, aggregations, and trend analysis.

With these prerequisites in place, you'll be well-prepared to embark on your stock data analytics journey using Airbyte, the Polygon Stock API, and MongoDB.
