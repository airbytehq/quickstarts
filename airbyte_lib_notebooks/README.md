# AirbyteLib Notebooks Quickstart

This quickstart will help you get started quickly with AirbyteLib.

## How to use these quickstarts.

There are three ways to use the quickstart resources here.

### Google Colab

Google Colab ("Colab" for short) is a hosted version of Jupyter. Because it is hosted by google, most people can access Colab using their existing Google account. To use these notebooks in Colab, click on the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the file.

Note:

- Colab doesn't come with virtual environment ("venv") support by default. For this reason, our demo workbooks start by installing venv support as a prerequisite, using `apt-get`.

### Self-Hosted Jupyter

If you have a self-hosted Jupyter instance, you can load any of the notebooks in this directory.

### VS Code Notebooks

You can run these notebooks natively in VS Code if you have the Python extension installed. You can also use GitHub Codespaces to open a new VS Code devcontainer in your web browser.
