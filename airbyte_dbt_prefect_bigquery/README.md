## Prerequisites

Before you embark on this integration, ensure you have the following set up and ready:

1. **Python 3.10 or later**: If not installed, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Docker and Docker Compose (Docker Desktop)**: Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) following the official documentation for your specific OS.

3. **Airbyte OSS version**: Deploy the open-source version of Airbyte locally. Follow the installation instructions from the [Airbyte Documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/quickstart/deploy-airbyte/).

4. **Terraform (Optional)**: Terraform will help you provision and manage the Airbyte resources. If you haven't installed it, follow the [official Terraform installation guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli). This is an optional step because you can also create and manage Airbyte resources via the UI. Both ways will be described below.

5. **Google Cloud account with BigQuery**: You will also need to add the necessary permissions to allow Airbyte and dbt to access the data in BigQuery. A step-by-step guide is provided [below](#2-setting-up-bigquery).

## 3. Setting Up Airbyte Connectors

To set up your Airbyte connectors, you can choose to do it via Terraform, or the UI. Choose one of the two following options.

### 3.1. Setting Up Airbyte Connectors with Terraform

Airbyte allows you to create connectors for sources and destinations via Terraform, facilitating data synchronization between various platforms. Here's how you can set this up:

1. **Navigate to the Airbyte Configuration Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd infra/airbyte
   ```

2. **Modify Configuration Files**:

   Within the `infra/airbyte` directory, you'll find three crucial Terraform files:
    - `provider.tf`: Defines the Airbyte provider.
    - `main.tf`: Contains the main configuration for creating Airbyte resources.
    - `variables.tf`: Holds various variables, including credentials.

   Adjust the configurations in these files to suit your project's needs: 

   - Provide credentials for your BigQuery connection in the `main.tf` file.
      - `dataset_id`: The name of the BigQuery dataset where Airbyte will load data. In this case, enter ‚Äúraw_data‚Äù.
      - `project_id`: Your BigQuery project ID.
      - `credentials_json`: The contents of the service account JSON file. You should input a string, so you need to convert the JSON content to string beforehand.
      - `workspace_id`: Your Airbyte workspace ID, which can be found in the webapp url. For example, in this url: http://localhost:8000/workspaces/910ab70f-0a67-4d25-a983-999e99e1e395/ the workspace id would be `910ab70f-0a67-4d25-a983-999e99e1e395`.

   - Alternatively, you can utilize the `variables.tf` file to manage these credentials:
      - You‚Äôll be prompted to enter the credentials when you execute `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. If going for this option, just move to the next step. If you don‚Äôt want to use variables, remove them from the file.

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   
   This step prepares Terraform to create the resources defined in your configuration files.
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Review the Plan**:

   Before applying any changes, review the plan to understand what Terraform will do.
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply Configuration**:

   After reviewing and confirming the plan, apply the Terraform configurations to create the necessary Airbyte resources.
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

6. **Verify in Airbyte UI**:

   Once Terraform completes its tasks, navigate to the [Airbyte UI](http://localhost:8000/). Here, you should see your source and destination connectors, as well as the connection between them, set up and ready to go üéâ.

### 3.2. Setting Up Airbyte Connectors Using the UI

Start by launching the Airbyte UI by going to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser. Then:

1. **Create a source**:

   - Go to the Sources tab and click on `+ New source`.
   - Search for ‚Äúfaker‚Äù using the search bar and select `Sample Data (Faker)`.
   - Adjust the Count and optional fields as needed for your use case. You can also leave as is. 
   - Click on `Set up source`.

2. **Create a destination**:

   - Go to the Destinations tab and click on `+ New destination`.
   - Search for ‚Äúbigquery‚Äù using the search bar and select `BigQuery`.
   - Enter the connection details as needed.
   - For simplicity, you can use `Standard Inserts` as the loading method.
   - In the `Service Account Key JSON` field, enter the contents of the JSON file. Yes, the full JSON.
   - Click on `Set up destination`.

3. **Create a connection**:

   - Go to the Connections tab and click on `+ New connection`.
   - Select the source and destination you just created.
   - Enter the connection details as needed.
   - Click on `Set up connection`.

That‚Äôs it! Your connection is set up and ready to go! üéâ 

## 4. Setting Up the dbt Project

[dbt (data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/) allows you to transform your data by writing, documenting, and executing SQL workflows. Setting up the dbt project requires specifying connection details for your data platform, in this case, BigQuery. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you set this up:

1. **Navigate to the dbt Project Directory**:

   Move to the directory containing the dbt configuration:
   ```bash
   cd ../../dbt_project
   ```

2. **Update Connection Details**:

   - You'll find a `profiles.yml` file within the directory. This file contains configurations for dbt to connect with your data platform. Update this file with your BigQuery connection details. Specifically, you need to update the Service Account JSON file path, the dataset location and your BigQuery project ID.
   - Provide your BigQuery project ID in the `database` field of the `/models/ecommerce/sources/faker_sources.yml` file.

   If you want to avoid hardcoding credentials in the `profiles.yml` file, you can leverage environment variables. Here's an example: `keyfile: "{{ env_var('DBT_BIGQUERY_KEYFILE_PATH', '') }}"`

3. **Test the Connection (Optional)**:
   You can test the connection to your BigQuery instance using the following command. Just take into account that you would need to provide the local path to your service account key file instead.
   
   ```bash
   dbt debug
   ```
   
   If everything is set up correctly, this command should report a successful connection to BigQuery üéâ.

## 5. Orchestrating with Prefect

[Prefect](https://prefect.io/) is an orchestration workflow tool that makes it easy to build, run, and monitor data workflows by writing Python code. In this section, we'll walk you through creating a Prefect flow to orchestrate both Airbyte extract and load operations, and dbt transformations with Python:

1. **Navigate to the Orchestration Directory**:

   Switch to the directory containing the Prefect orchestration configurations:
   ```bash
   cd ../orchestration
   ```

2. **Update the Airbyte Connection ID**:

   Open the `my_elt_flow.py` Python script and update the `connection_id` key in the `airbyte_connection` object.

   To find your connection id go to the [Airbyte UI](http://localhost:8000/), then select the connection you want to use from the "Connections" tab and copy the ID from the URL (you'll find it after `/connections/`, i.e., `e3646db8-6612-4142-8edf-1e51932b6836`).

3. **Set Environment Variables**:

   Prefect requires certain environment variables to be set to interact with other tools, like Airbyte. Set the following variables:

   ```bash
   export AIRBYTE_PASSWORD=password
   ```

   Additionally, set the following environment variable to avoid unnecessary notifications from Prefect:

   ```bash
   export PREFECT_API_SERVICES_FLOW_RUN_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
   ```
   
4. **Connect to Prefect's API**:

   Open a new terminal window. Start a local Prefect server instance in your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   prefect server start
   ```

5. **Deploy the Flow**:

   Go back to your previous terminal and execute the following python script:

   ```bash
   python my_elt_flow.py
   ```

   When you run the flow script, Prefect will automatically create a flow deployment that you can interact with via the UI and API. The script will stay running so that it can listen for scheduled or triggered runs of this flow; once a run is found, it will be executed within a subprocess.

6. **Access Prefect UI in Your Browser**:

   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:4200
   ```
   You can now begin interacting with your newly created deployment! üéâ
