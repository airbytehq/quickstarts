# Notes

- These models are basic starting points. You can further refine and expand on them based on the insights you
want and the intricacies of your GitHub data.

- Make sure to adjust field names if they don't match the schema of the data you've extracted from GitHub into BigQuery.

- It might also be beneficial to integrate other dbt packages or custom macros to handle more advanced transformations or aggregations as needed.

- Always remember to test your models with dbt to ensure they run correctly and produce the expected results.
